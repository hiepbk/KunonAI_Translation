Tree canopy segmentation plays a vital role in preventing utility-related hazards and ensuring efficient vegetation management. Inaccurate segmentation can hinder clearance calculations for linear assets, disrupt routine RoW maintenance, and reduce the effectiveness of tree health or species classification systems. Overlapping canopies and varying sensor resolutions create mixed signals that confuse models and lower performance. Current approaches often fail to generalize across regions and imagery types, limiting their real-world utility. This leads to a pressing need for models that not only perform well in controlled conditions but are resilient in the diverse and noisy data typical of field deployments. A general-purpose solution is needed to bring consistency, safety,and automation to this domain.

**Solfane Competition platform invites users all over the world to participate in a unique Tree Canopy Detection challenge aimed at** **solving this global issue. By engaging with a range of high-resolution and sensor-agnostic imagery datasets, participants will be** tasked with building and validating segmentation models that excel in complex and variable environments. This competition encourages innovation in machine learning and geospatial AI, with real-world impact in utility safety and environmental monitoring. Evaluation criteria will emphasize robustness across locations, clarity of canopy separation, and computational efficiency. Top solutions will be recognized and may be deployed in critical vegetation management workflows worldwide. Join the Solafune platform to push the boundaries of what's possible in tree canopy detection.
