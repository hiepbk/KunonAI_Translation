Tree canopy segmentation plays a vital role in preventing utility-related hazards and ensuring efficient vegetation management. Inaccurate segmentation can hinder clearance calculations for linear assets, disrupt routine RoW maintenance, and reduce the effectiveness of tree health or species classification systems. Overlapping canopies and varying sensor resolutions create mixed signals that confuse models and lower performance. Current approaches often fail to generalize across regions and imagery types, limiting their real-world utility. This leads to a pressing need for models that not only perform well in controlled conditions but are resilient in the diverse and noisy data typical of field deployments. A general-purpose solution is needed to bring consistency, safety,and automation to this domain.
